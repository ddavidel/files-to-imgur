# files-to-imgur
 
This project aims to save any type of file as an image on imgur for free.
It's still deeeeeeep in development so crucial changes will be made.

Important features:
> This is the first project using my personal pseudo database structure: ddevdb. I'll probably create a dedicate repo for this
> A lot of stuff that I'll add later...
